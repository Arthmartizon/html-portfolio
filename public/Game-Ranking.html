  <p>
    Uncharted is my top 1 game, you will know when you play the game becuase its
    almost near to reality in the real word about cartels.
    <br />
    <br />
    A Thief's End is Nathan "Nate" Drake (Nolan North), a veteran adventurer and
    explorer who, following the events of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception (2011),
    has retired from fortune hunting alongside his wife Elena Fisher (Emily
    Rose), a journalist, to a more normal life, and taken up employment with a
    salvage company in New Orleans. The game introduces Samuel "Sam" Drake (Troy
    Baker), Nate's older brother, who was presumed dead. Drawn back into his old
    life of adventure by his brother, Nathan is aided by his long-term friend,
    fellow adventurer, mentor and father figure Victor "Sully" Sullivan (Richard
    McGonagle). Their journey to find and recover the long-lost treasure of
    pirate Henry Avery brings them into conflict with wealthy and dangerous
    businessman and treasure hunter Rafe Adler (Warren Kole), his partner Nadine
    Ross (Laura Bailey) who runs the private mercenary group Shoreline, and drug
    lord Hector Alcazar (Robin Atkin Downes). The child versions of Nate and Sam
    are portrayed by Britain Dalton and Chase Austin, respectively.

  <p>
    A way out is my top 2 game, it has a multiplayer which is a form of
    cooperation during the game to finish it.
    <br />
    <br />
    A Way Out is an action-adventure video game developed by Hazelight Studios
    and published by Electronic Arts. It is the second video game to be directed
    by Josef Fares after Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. A Way Out does not have a
    single-player option; it is playable on local or online split screen co-op
    between two players. The game was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and
    Xbox One on March 23, 2018, selling over a million copies in two weeks.

  <p>
    Sekiro is my top 3 game, a difficult game but very good story and has 3
    types of ending.
    <br />
    <br />
    Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice[a] is a 2019 action-adventure game developed by
    FromSoftware. It was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in
    March 2019 and for Stadia in October 2020 by FromSoftware in Japan and
    Activision internationally. The game follows a shinobi known as Wolf, who
    attempts to take revenge on a samurai clan that imprisoned him and kidnapped
    his lord. The gameplay is focused on stealth, exploration, and combat, with
    a particular emphasis on boss battles. It takes place in a fictionalized
    Japan during the Sengoku period and makes strong references to Buddhist
    mythology and philosophy.
